<font size="3px"><p>The University of California Santa Barbaraâ€™s coastal location makes it a prime university to study marine science. This summer highly engaged and motivated high school students from around the United States participated in a 6 week marine science course taught by Dr. Anna James to do just that. </p>

<p>After learning about marine processes, ecosystems, and biodiversity, the class culminated in groups projects, which focused on the importance of biodiversity and how humans affect biodiversity.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, the students developed informative brochures and flyers focused on chosen issues threatening biodiversity - such as plastic pollution. Using their printed media, the students spoke to other students and faculty members about how the chosen issue is threatening marine biodiversity. </p>

<p>A few of the groups produced videos to share their chosen issue and their interactions about the issue with others. </p>
