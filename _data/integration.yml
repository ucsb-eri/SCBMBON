- title: "Biological Data"
  text: "Subtidal biodiversity in nearshore communities is one of the most widely researched and documented fields in the Santa Barbara Channel, with numerous programs having monitored a combined hundreds of sites for over 30 years. By integrating data from these various programs, we are able to analyze the abundance of fish invertebrates, and algae with much higher spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, our focus is on nearshore communities for which we have assembled data from 173 sites monitored by 4 different programs, many of which have 30+ year data series. These datasets document abundance spanning more than 350 distinct taxa including fish, invertebrates and algae. To facilitate data synthesis, we have been developing a taxonomic database to enable comparison of biodiversity data from different sources. This taxonomic database is designed to be scalable to accommodate the integration of taxa from additional data sets."

- title: "Physical Data"
  text: "As our goal is to use these results to develop regional scale inference about patterns of marine biodiversity, we focus on physical data for which we have continuous coverage within the region. These data include: By combining biological data with physical data, we aim to analyze the physical drivers of marine biodiversity."
