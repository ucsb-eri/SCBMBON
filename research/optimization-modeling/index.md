title: 'Optimization Modeling'
description: A primary objective of the Southern California Bight Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (SCB MBON) is to weigh the costs and benefits of various methods employed in the monitoring of marine biodiversity, to provide a foundation for efficient monitoring of marine biodiversity in the future.

		<blockquote><p class="lead">A major goal of the SCB MBON is to compare the 
		effectiveness of different methods of biodiversity sampling, exploring how 
		the optimal mix of sampling depends on the goals of monitoring and the resources 
		available.</p></blockquote>

<div class="col-md-8">
		<p>To maximize effectiveness, SCB MBON will be targeted sampling to address 
		key data gaps, while making best use of existing sampling efforts, thereby 
		gaining a complete description of biodiversity while minimizing cost. Optimal 
		decisions about data collection require the construction of a framework for 
		balancing costs and benefits of alternative sampling.</p>
		<p>We also look to consider how the optimal mix will change as technology 
		improves (e.g., lower cost and better accuracy of genetic and computational 
		methods). Much of this work will be based on assimilated biodiversity data 
		derived from a range of sampling methods.</p>
